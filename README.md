CLIc
====

A command line chess game, written in Python

CLIc is still under development and has not yet been tested fully.
As each new function is built (or existing functions amended) a
brief test has been carried out to ensure that the function works;
it has not been sanity tested so the game in its current form is buggy

As this receives alpha version updates, more extensive testing will be
carried out prior to a release candidate push/commit to GitHub
